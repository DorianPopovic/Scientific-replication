This notebook attempts to repdroduce **Table 4** from the [Housing, Health and Happiness](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233657087_Housing_Health_And_Happiness) publication. 

In this study, researchers investigated the causal impact that housing improvement programs have on health and welfare. More specifically, they analyzed the effects of floor quality on the health of children and on the happiness and mental health of adults by using data from the "Piso Firme Project" (PFP) which replaced dirt floors by concrete cement flooring in Mexican households.

In order for the replacement of dirt floors with cement provided by PFP to have beneficial effects on child and adult health, it was first necessary to ensure that PFP had a significant impact in terms of cement flooring in the households in which it was implemented. The authors first analysed the state level trends in cement floors and the results were in accordance with the hypothesis that PFP had an impact on cement flooring at the state level. Here we focus on estimating the program impact on cement flooring at the household level.
