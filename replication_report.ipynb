    "This notebook attempts to repdroduce **Table 4** from the [Housing, Health and Happiness](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.1.1.75) publication. In this study, researchers investigated the causal impact that housing improvement programs have on health and welfare. More specifically, they analyzed the effects of floor quality on the health of children and on the happiness and mental health of adults by using data from the **\"Piso Firme Project\"** (PFP) which replaced dirt floors by concrete cement flooring in Mexican households. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In order for the replacement of dirt floors with cement provided by PFP to have beneficial effects on child and adult health, it was first necessary to ensure that PFP had a significant impact in terms of cement flooring in the households in which it was implemented. The authors first analysed the state level trends in cement floors and the results were in accordance with the hypothesis that PFP had an impact on cement flooring at the state level. Here we focus on estimating the program impact on cement flooring at the household level."

    "### **Estimated Program Impact on Cement Floors**\n",
    "The aim here is to investigate the impact of PFP implementation on the presence of cement floors at the household level. For this we analyse the effect of the program in terms of coverage of cement floors in the treated households. Indeed it might be possible that households that did not beneficiate from the program replaced their dirt floors on their own, and this has to be controlled for. The following outcome indicators are examined:\n",
    "* *Share of rooms with cement floors*\n",
    "* *Kitchen has cement floor (dummy variable)*\n",
    "* *Dining room has cement floor (dummy variable)*\n",
    "* *Bathroom has cement floor (dummy variable)*\n",
    "* *Household members sleep in rooms with a cement floor (dummy variable)*\n",
    "\n",
    "PFP impact is estimated by regressing each of these dependent variables on a dummy variable indicating whether PFP was implemented in the household or not. For each dependent variable, 3 different linear regression models are estimated.\n",
    "#### **Model 1**\n",
    "The first model estimates the treatment effect (whether PFP was implemented in the household or not) directly by regressing each independent variable on a dummy variable that is equal to 1 if PFP was implemented and equal to 0 otherwise. No control variables were added.\n",
    "#### **Model 2**\n",
    "The second model adds the following demographic and health control variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Demographic Control Variables** | **Health Control Variables** |\n",
    "--- | --- |\n",
    "*Household size* | *Animals* (dummy) |\n",
    "*Number of rooms in the household* | *Animals can enter the house* (dummy) | \n",
    "*Education years of household head* | *Water connection outside* (dummy) |\n",
    "*Education years of household spouse* | *Water connection inside* (dummy) |\n",
    "*Age of household head* | *Electricity* (dummy) |\n",
    "*Age of household spouse* | *Number of times the respondent washed hands before interview* |\n",
    "*Group specific demographic (8)* | *Garbage collection service* (dummy) |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Model 3**\n",
    "The third model adds several control variables to Model 2 to control for benefits from other social programs:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Social Program Benefits Control Variables** |\n",
    "--- |\n",
    "*Monetary transfer from social programs* |\n",
    "*Milk supplement program* (dummy) |\n",
    "*Any food program* (dummy) |\n",
    "*Seguro Popular (health insurance)* (dummy) |"

    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "Overall, the results tell us that PFP succeeded in installing cement floors in the treated households for almost all of the household floor space and they agree with the results reported in the [Housing, Health and Happiness](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.1.1.75) study paper despite some small differences in **Model 2** and **Model 3**. These differences will be discussed in the next section.\n",
    "### **Discussion**\n",
    "As mentionned previously the replication results agree with the study results but there are some small discrepancies regarding the coefficients in **Model 2** and **Model 3** that cannot be explained by differences in rounding only. These discrepancies also cannot come from differences in the dataset as **Control Group** and **Model 1** show identical results and the same dataset is used throughout this replication. Therefore the only explanations are either an error in the model itself (for example false control variables used) or an error in the description of the model in the paper. When analysing the replication code `PisoFirme_AEJPol-20070024_STATA-replication-code.do` that is provided together with the dataset, even though the variable **S_rooms** that represents the *number of rooms* in the household is mentionned to be controlled for in both models in the paper, it is actually not controlled for in the replication code. Below are reported the results for **Model 2** and **Model 3** when the variable **S_rooms** is  removed."

    "Note that once the **S_rooms** control variable was removed from both models, the obtained results are identical. It is therefore most likely that researchers forgot to control for **S_rooms** in their model even though they mentionned it in the paper. Despite these small differences, the effects are still the same and remain statistically significant in both cases. Overall, this pure replication analysis concludes that results in **Table 4** from the [Housing, Health and Happiness](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.1.1.75) publication can be replicated and that there might be some minor errors that do not alter the original author’s main conclusions."

    "When using the same methods as previously, we can see that that **Satisfaction with floor quality**, **Satisfaction with house quality** and **Satisfaction with quality of life** are correctly reproduced. However, the last two row, **Depression scale (CES-D scale)** and **Perceived stress scale (PSS)** are not identical. The sign on the coefficient is the same (negative) as excpected but the values are not the same. Because the **control groupe mean** is not the same, the differences are probably due to a change in number of observations. Indeed if we look at **Table 1** from th study, the number of observations for these last 2 variables is not the same as for every other variable used in this notebook. In this next part we will create two separate dataframe and drop observation based on **NaN** values for the **depression** and **stress** features."
